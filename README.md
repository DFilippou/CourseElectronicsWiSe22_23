This is the repository for the code used in the class 63-769:Practical Measurement Electronics and Interfaces in Ocean Sciences.
We develop a data logger suitable to use with a DS18B20 temperature sensor. We design a circuit that
includes an Arduino board and a resistor to use alongside the temperature sensor.
We calibrate the instrument in the Sea Ice Lab of the University of Hamburg 
and compare it to other sensors of the same type. More information can be found in the report attached.
